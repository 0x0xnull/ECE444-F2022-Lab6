## What are the pros and cons of TDD?

# Pros of TDD are that:

1. it brings everyone on same page for the requirments
2. Gives more importance to testing which is something that is often overlooked
3. Easily adapted by Agility methodology
4. Makes it so that the testing process is not rushed but rather integrated intp the development itself
5. Forces automation of testing which is good in the long run for many projects

# Cons of TDD are that:

1. Takes more time for testing
2. Writing too many tests waste of time and resources
3. Trivial tests that dont really matter
4. Sometimes can be difficult to write test code before implementation
5. Refactoring implementation breaks testing and hence tests need to be rewritten
